# Project: My portfolio

This project was about following a design example to create my own portfolio. The structure, fonts and proportions were set from start but I made my own choices with colours, hover effects, images etc. The webpage should also be accessible, i.e. it should be possible to read with screenreader, have good colour contrast and have semantic html.

# Design

This project took a long time since it included a lot of elements and a lot of design to get right. The design example was in Figma and it was not exact in all measurements, but more like a sketch. So I had to make choices on which measurements to use.

# Accessibility

I tested my page with WAVE (web accessibility evaluation tool) and Webaim contrast checker. I also used a validator from W3C Markup Validation Service and corrected the faults that appeared. I tried using the Chromebook built-in screenreader and it worked alright. I also tried tabbing around the page and it. I have looked at the webpage in Chrome on a Chromebook as well as in Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox on a PC with Windows. I also tried it in my Android phone.
